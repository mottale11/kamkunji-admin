# Ecommerce Integration Guide

## Overview

The admin dashboard is now fully integrated with the public ecommerce site through Supabase real-time synchronization. When you perform actions in the admin panel, they are automatically reflected on the public ecommerce site in real-time.

## How It Works

### 1. Shared Database
Both the admin site and public ecommerce site use the same Supabase database, ensuring data consistency.

### 2. Real-Time Sync
- **Supabase Realtime**: Uses PostgreSQL's logical replication to sync changes instantly
- **Automatic Updates**: Changes made in admin are immediately visible on the ecommerce site
- **No Manual Sync Required**: Everything happens automatically

## Features

### Product Management
- ✅ **Add New Product**: Automatically appears on ecommerce site
- ✅ **Update Product**: Changes reflected immediately on ecommerce site
- ✅ **Delete Product**: Removed from ecommerce site instantly
- ✅ **Image Uploads**: Stored in Supabase Storage, accessible from both sites

### Order Management
- ✅ **Order Status Updates**: Customer can see real-time order status changes
- ✅ **New Orders**: Automatically appear in admin dashboard
- ✅ **Order History**: Synced between admin and customer views

### Item Submissions
- ✅ **New Submissions**: Automatically appear for admin review
- ✅ **Approval/Rejection**: Status changes sync to customer dashboard
- ✅ **Product Creation**: Approved submissions become live products

## Real-Time Indicators

### Live Sync Status
- **Green Dot + "Live Sync"**: Connected and syncing in real-time
- **Red Dot + "Offline"**: Connection issues, manual refresh may be needed

### Console Logs
Check browser console for real-time sync events:
- Product changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Order updates
- Submission status changes

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Supabase Realtime Subscriptions
```typescript
// Subscribe to all changes in products table
supabase
  .channel('admin-ecommerce-sync')
  .on('postgres_changes', { table: 'products' }, handleChange)
  .subscribe()
```

### 2. Image Storage
- **Bucket**: `product-images`
- **Public Access**: Images are publicly accessible
- **Automatic URLs**: Generated URLs work on both sites

### 3. Database Triggers
- **Automatic Timestamps**: `created_at`, `updated_at`
- **Order Numbers**: Auto-generated unique order numbers
- **Status Updates**: Real-time status propagation

## Benefits

1. **Instant Updates**: No waiting for data to sync
2. **Data Consistency**: Both sites always show the same information
3. **Better UX**: Customers see changes immediately
4. **Reduced Errors**: No manual sync required
5. **Scalable**: Handles multiple concurrent users

## Troubleshooting

### Sync Issues
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Supabase connection in network tab
3. Refresh the page to re-establish connection
4. Check if Supabase service is running

### Image Upload Issues
1. Verify Supabase Storage bucket exists
2. Check file size limits (max 5MB)
3. Ensure proper file types (PNG, JPG, GIF)
4. Check browser console for upload errors

### Performance
- Real-time sync uses minimal bandwidth
- Only changed data is transmitted
- Automatic reconnection on network issues

## Future Enhancements
